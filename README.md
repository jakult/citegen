### A simple, Markdown XL compatible CLI citation machine for academic writing. (Specifically, mine.)<br /><br />

#### The objective is to build a citation machine that does three things: <br />
1. Add a new citation to a text file. <br />
2. Retrieve an existing citation from a text file using a search function. <br />
3. Create an in-text version of an existing citation. <br /><br />

#### There are plenty of more sophsticated citation machines out there. The reason for keeping it simple and CLI-based is: <br />
1. Web-based interfaces like RefWorks are either horrible to use or excessively complicated. <br />
2. I write in Markdown XL. Most commerical citation software is not Markdown XL compatible. <br />
3. A command line interface suits my workflow better. I'm already typing a lot. It's easier to tab over to a CLI and continue doing that that start using the trackpad to navigate a GUI. <br />
4. Normally, my academic writing normally requires citing primary and secondary sources. I have developed a way of doing so in-text that does not clutter up the document, and a standardized format for listing a wide range of primary sources in the bibliography. Commercial software does not permit this kind of customization.
