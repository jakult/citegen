# citegen
A simple, Markdown XL compatible CLI citation machine for academic writing

The objective is to build a simple citation machine that does three things:
1   Add a new citation to a text file
2   Retrieve an existing citation from a text file using a search function
3   From an existing citation, create an in-text version
